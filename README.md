### Hello, my name is Louis Dittmar. ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
### I love programming, and I am very much interested in java and HTML.

# Notable Projects:

> ## Website - Computerservice
>This website was created for a small computer service in Coburg, for which I sometimes help out with small projects. We used a GitHub page to publish this project based on HTML5 Boilerplate. https://weigeltmic.github.io/IT-Computerservice-Weigelt/

> ## Website
> A collection of all the websites I've created so far and will be creating. Unfortunately the main page is not currently finished.
> However, I am currently working on finishing this website.

> ## Passwort Generator
> A password generator that I created to test how to work with J-Frames. This one works but it's very simple. The project was created entirely in Java.

> ## MyCommands & BetterCommands
>These projects are for plugins that I have made for Minecraft Servers. There are two versions of the plugin with small variations in functionality and what commands it uses.
